HI GJ 

4. Accounting system (Shumin)
Learn how to manage our financial status is an important lesson for all of us. More and more people
choose to use digital tools to manage their wealth efficiently. In this idea, we target to build an
accounting system to help people keep track of their income and expense. Minimally, the system
shall include basic functions including 1) add records of income and expenses; 2) the records should
contain some basic information, like amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game,
salary, etc.), account (e.g cash, bank card, credit card, etc.); 3) the records could be deleted and edited
at any time; 4) users could view their records by date, type, and account; 5) the system should
provide statistical report of users’ financial state (e.g. monthly income and expenses, percentage of
food expenses, etc.); and 6) the accounting system allows budget setting. When expenses reach the
budget, there should be an alert from the system. Add a function you think is useful to the system but
not previously mentioned.



how about we make a two dimension array?
Acc_system[num of row][num of col]
num of row= number of user
num of col= number of entity
