Program: Accounting System

----------------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement:

An accounting system will be designed as a digital tool to manage wealth and financial status efficiently. The system will help by keeping track of the user's income and expense, and appropriately present the data to the user.

----------------------------------------------------------

Problem Setting:

More than one user can use the system. User chris_wong is already registered, password 123.
Although measures are put in place, assume the user inputs are rational, eg. Will only input numbers when prompted to enter numbers, input characters when prompted to enter characters.

Program Functions (1-6 are basic function requirements, 7-10 are other useful functions):
1) Add records of income and expenses; 
2) Records contain amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game, salary, etc.), account (e.g cash, bank card, credit card, etc.);
3) The records can be deleted or edited at any time; 
4) The user could view their records by date, type, and account;
5) The system should provide statistical report of usersâ€™ financial state (e.g. monthly income and expenses, percentage of food expenses, etc.);
6) The accounting system allows budget setting. Mainly tells the user how much to use per day in order to reach a certain saving goal, per month;
7) Create a function to see the trend of the expense. Shows how much you save per day, and how many days to save a certain amount or how much you can save after a period of time;
8) A login ID and password will be required at the beginning for the users to login to their account;
9) A sign up function can be used for new users;
10) Export a financial report
